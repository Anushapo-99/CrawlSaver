    CrawlSaver - A library for managing web scraping interruptions.
    
    This class provides functionality to save, load, and clear checkpoints
    during web scraping operations. It allows scraping processes to be 
    resumed from where they left off after interruptions.
    
    Checkpoints are stored as JSON data in text files for easy reading
    and modification if needed.
    
    Attributes:
        checkpoint_file (str): Path to the file where checkpoint data is stored.
                               Defaults to "checkpoint.txt" in the current directory.
    
    Example:
        >>> saver = CrawlSaver("my_scraper_checkpoint.txt")
        >>> # Save progress after processing a page
        >>> saver.save_checkpoint({"page": 5, "url": "https://example.com/page/5"})
        >>> # Later, load the checkpoint to resume
        >>> checkpoint = saver.load_checkpoint()
        >>> if checkpoint and saver.prompt_resume():
        >>>     start_page = checkpoint["page"]
